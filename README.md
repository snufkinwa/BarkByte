# BarkByte: Dog Image Classifier

This project is part of my AWS AI/ML Scholarship at Udacity in the AI Programming with Python nanodegree. I use a provided image classifier to identify dog breeds, focusing on Python tools for preprocessing, classifier use, and evaluation. The goal is to determine the best algorithm for classifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs," identify breeds, and analyze accuracy versus runtime.

### Programming Project

- [Intro to Python Project - Classifying Pet Images:](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND-revision/tree/master/intropyproject-classify-pet-images "Classifying Pet Images Project") Determine which CNN architecture model works best at classifying images of dogs and their breeds.

## Dependencies

Each directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.

### pip

To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
